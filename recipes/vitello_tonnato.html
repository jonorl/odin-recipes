    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This summery dish hails from the Piedmont region of Italy. It's perfect for a light summer meal or as an appetizer. This is the original version using hard-boiled eggs. Some recipes call for mayonnaise, but trust me, this version is the authentic. Serve with a crisp, dry white wine.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>1 cup water</ul>
        <ul>½ cup vegetable broth</ul>
        <ul>½ cup white wine</ul>
        <ul>1 clove garlic</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</ul>
        <ul>5 whole cloves</ul>
        <ul>2 large bay leaves</ul>
        <ul>1 pound "magatello" cut of veal</ul>

        <ul>2 large unpeeled potatoes, washed and halved</ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Combine water, vegetable broth, wine, garlic, peppercorns, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, cloves, and bay leaves in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add a steamer basket. It's okay if the liquid is higher than the bottom of the basket. </p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Leave veal whole, but trim off any excess fat or skin. Place it into the basket. Add onion and place potatoes on top. Make sure the potatoes aren't touching the liquid. </p>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. </p>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Combine eggs, drained tuna, anchovies, 3 teaspoons capers, and olive oil in a bowl. Mash into a coarse paste with a fork. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. </p>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Release any remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Carefully remove the potatoes and onion; set aside. </p>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <p>Remove the veal and allow to cool. Wrap the veal in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. </p>
            <h4>Step 7</h4>
                <p>Strain and reserve the broth. Add some of the cooled broth to the sauce. Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce until smooth and creamy, adding broth little by little as needed. Refrigerate, reserving the broth in case you need it to thin the sauce before serving. </p>
            <h4>Step 8</h4>
                <p>Slice the veal as thinly as possible with a carving knife. Arrange the slices on a plate. Slice the potatoes and onions and arrange them on the plate. Top with tonnato sauce and garnish with remaining capers. Serve cold or at room temperature. </p>
